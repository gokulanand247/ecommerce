## 📋 What You Need To Do (Database & Backend Setup)

### Step 1: Run SQL Migrations (Required) ⚠️

**File to use**: `NEW_SQL_MIGRATIONS.sql`

1. Log in to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Create a new query
5. Copy the entire contents of `NEW_SQL_MIGRATIONS.sql`
6. Paste into the SQL Editor
7. Click **"Run"**
8. Wait for "Success" message

**This creates**:
- ✅ Reviews table with real-time subscriptions
- ✅ Split order views for sellers
- ✅ Admin order views with seller info
- ✅ Auto-verify reviews for purchases
- ✅ Payment tracking improvements
- ✅ Seller information fields

### Step 2: Set Up Razorpay Webhooks (Highly Recommended) ⚠️

**File to follow**: `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`

**Quick Steps**:

1. **Razorpay Dashboard Setup** (5 minutes)
   - Go to Settings → Webhooks
   - Add new webhook URL
   - Select events: `payment.captured`, `payment.failed`
   - Generate and save webhook secret

2. **Create Edge Function** (10 minutes)
   - Follow the guide in `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`
   - Copy the provided Edge Function code
   - Deploy to Supabase

3. **Add Environment Variable**
   - In Supabase: Settings → Edge Functions
   - Add: `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - Value: Your webhook secret from Razorpay

4. **Set Up Cron Job** (5 minutes)
   - Use Cron-job.org (free)
   - Call cancel-unpaid-orders function every 15 min
   - See guide for details

**Why This Is Important**:
- ❌ Without webhooks: Orders placed even if payment fails
- ✅ With webhooks: Only successful payments confirm orders
- ✅ Unpaid orders auto-cancel after 30 minutes
