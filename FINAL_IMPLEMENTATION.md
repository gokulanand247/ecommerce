### 2. Featured Products Section - ADDED
**Location**: Above "Shop by Category" section

**Features**:
- New `featured_products` database table
- Links to products via product_id
- First 6 products automatically featured
- "Featured" badge on products

INSERT INTO featured_products (product_id, sort_order)

```

### 3. Mobile Category Alignment - FIXED
**Problem**: Categories were not aligned properly on mobile

**Solution**:

- Grid: 2 columns on mobile, flex on larger screens
- Better spacing (gap-3 on mobile, gap-4 on desktop)
- Proper text sizing (text-sm on mobile, text-base on desktop)
- Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping

**Mobile View**:
```
[All Products] [Sarees]
[Western]      [Ethnic]
[Party]        [Casual]
```

### 4. Scroll to Top - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: When clicking anything, page stayed at the same scroll position

**Solution**: Added `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })` to:

‚úÖ Category selection
‚úÖ Product click
‚úÖ Footer navigation
‚úÖ Back button on product detail
‚úÖ Back button on all footer pages
‚úÖ All navigation changes

**Result**: Smooth scroll to top on every navigation action
