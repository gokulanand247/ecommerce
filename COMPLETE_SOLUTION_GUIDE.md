                  - Size/Color Selection

[Product Details Section] ← NEW!
  - Category, Sizes, Colors, Stock
  - Full Description
  - Product Features (with icons)

[Customer Reviews]
```

### ✅ 3. Related Products Algorithm
**Files:**
- `src/utils/relatedProducts.ts` (NEW)
- `src/components/ProductDetail.tsx` (UPDATED)

**How it works:**
1. **Category Match** (Score +3): Products from same category get highest priority
2. **Color Match** (Score +2): Products with similar colors
3. **Price Range** (Score +1): Products within ±30% price range
4. Products are sorted by score and top 4 are displayed

**Example:**
- If viewing a "Red Evening Dress" at ₹2999
- Algorithm finds:
  - Other Evening Dresses (category match)
  - Red/Pink colored dresses (color match)
  - Dresses in ₹2000-₹4000 range (price match)

### ✅ 4. Mandatory Size/Color Selection
**File:** `src/components/ProductDetail.tsx`

**What changed:**
```typescript
// Before: Could add to cart without selecting
handleAddToCart() {
  onAddToCart(product);
}

// After: Validates selection first
handleAddToCart() {
  if (sizes exist && !selected) {
    showToast('Please select a size', 'error');
    return;
  }
  if (colors exist && !selected) {
    showToast('Please select a color', 'error');
    return;
  }
  onAddToCart(product);
  showToast('Added to cart!', 'success');
}
```

**User Experience:**
- Tries to add without selection → Red error toast appears
- Selects size and color → Green success toast appears

### ✅ 5. Order Creation Error Fixed
**File:** `src/services/orderService.ts`

**Issues that were causing errors:**
1. ❌ RLS policy violations
2. ❌ Missing error messages
3. ❌ No validation

**What was fixed:**
1. ✅ Better error handling with try-catch
2. ✅ Detailed console logging for debugging
3. ✅ User-friendly error messages
4. ✅ Order validation before proceeding

**Error Flow:**
```
Order Creation Attempt
  ↓
Check RLS Policies (from SQL migration)
  ↓

  ↓
Validate Success

```

**RLS Policies in SQL:**
```sql
-- Users can create their own orders
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own orders"
ON orders FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### ✅ 6. Review System Fixed
**File:** `src/components/ReviewForm.tsx`

**Previous Error:**
- Reviews were failing due to RLS policy rejecting inserts

**Solution:**
- Updated RLS policy to allow authenticated users to create reviews
- Allows user_id to be NULL for anonymous reviews (guest reviews)

**SQL Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create reviews"
ON reviews FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid() OR user_id IS NULL);
```
