# Implementation Guide - All Fixes Applied

## Overview

This guide explains all the fixes and improvements made to your e-commerce platform. All code changes are complete and the project builds successfully.

## 1. Environment Variables (.env)

Your `.env` file has been updated with placeholders for all required keys:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id_here
```

**Action Required:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

## 2. Database Migrations

All SQL migrations are in the `manual_migrations/` folder. You MUST run these in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **01_fix_stock_issues.sql** - Fixes stock management
2. **02_multi_seller_order_system.sql** - Implements multi-seller orders
3. **03_fix_reviews.sql** - Fixes review submission

See `manual_migrations/README.md` for detailed instructions.

## 3. Stock Management - FIXED

### What Was Fixed:
- Stock no longer falls back to 0 when creating/updating products
- Proper synchronization between `stock` and `stock_quantity` fields
- Automatic stock decrease when orders are placed
- Stock restoration when orders are cancelled
- Prevents negative stock values

### How It Works:
The database trigger ensures that when a seller/admin creates or updates a product with stock=10, it stays at 10 and doesn't revert to 0.

## 4. Low Stock Warning - IMPLEMENTED

Products now display low stock warnings in the product description:
- When stock is 3 or less: Shows "Only X left in stock!" in RED
- When stock is 0: Shows "Out of Stock" in RED

This appears on the ProductDetail page below the description.

## 5. Reviews - FIXED

### What Was Fixed:
- Review submission now works properly
- Proper RLS policies added for authenticated users
- Better error handling with toast notifications
- Fixed permission issues

Users can now submit reviews without errors.

## 6. Custom Toast Notifications - IMPLEMENTED

Replaced all `alert()` calls with a custom toast notification system:

### Features:
- Success (green), Error (red), and Info (blue) toasts
- Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds
- Manual close button
- Smooth animations
- Non-blocking UI

### Usage:
```typescript
import { showToast } from './components/Toast';

showToast('Success message', 'success');
showToast('Error message', 'error');
showToast('Info message', 'info');
```

## 7. Filter UI - REDESIGNED

The product filters now open in a modal/drawer:

### Features:
- Click "Filters & Sort" button to open modal
- All filters shown in a clean modal interface
- "Apply Filters" button to apply changes
- "Clear All" button (with X icon) to reset filters
- Changes only apply when you click "Apply Filters"
- Can cancel without applying changes

## 8. Today's Deals - FIXED

### What Was Fixed:
- Changed from RPC function to direct table query
- Now properly fetches deals from `todays_deals` table
- Filters by active status and time range
- Only shows products that exist

### To Add Deals:
Add products to the `todays_deals` table with:
- `is_active = true`
- `starts_at` before current time
- `ends_at` after current time

## 9. Password Hashing Utility - CREATED

Location: `src/utils/hash.js`

### How to Use:
```bash
node src/utils/hash.js your_password_here
```

This will output:
- Hashed password
- SQL query to update seller in database
- Verification test

### Example:
```bash
$ node src/utils/hash.js mySecurePassword123

=== Password Hashed Successfully ===

Hashed Password: a1b2c3d4e5f6...

You can use this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
UPDATE sellers SET password_hash = 'a1b2c3d4e5f6...' WHERE email = 'seller@example.com';
```

## 10. Multi-Seller Order System - IMPLEMENTED

This is the most complex feature. Here's how it works:

### For Users:
- When ordering products from multiple sellers, it appears as ONE order
- Single order ID, single payment
- Unified order view

### For Sellers:
- Sellers only see THEIR products from the order
- Can update status only for their items
- See the full bill for reference
- Cannot see other sellers' items

### For Admins:
- See the complete order
- Products are split by seller
- Can update status per seller
- Full visibility of all items

### Database Structure:
- `orders` table: Main order information
- `order_items` table: Individual items with seller info
- Automatic splitting when order is created
- Status sync between items and main order

### How It Works:

1. **User places order** with 3 products:
   - Product A from Seller 1
   - Product B from Seller 2
   - Product C from Seller 2

2. **System creates**:
   - 1 order record (user sees this)
   - 3 order_item records (system tracks these)
   - Items linked to respective sellers

3. **Seller 1 sees**:
   - Only Product A
   - Their portion of the payment
   - Full bill for reference

4. **Seller 2 sees**:
   - Product B and C
   - Their portion of the payment
   - Full bill for reference

5. **Order status**:
   - Each seller can update their items' status
   - Main order status = aggregate of all items
   - If all items delivered → order delivered
   - If any item shipped → order shows shipped

## 11. Order Status Syncing

The system automatically syncs order status based on item statuses:
- All items cancelled → Order cancelled
- All items delivered → Order delivered
- Any item shipped → Order shipped
- Any item processing → Order processing
- Default → Order pending

## Testing Checklist

After running the migrations, test these features:

1. **Stock Management**
   - Create a product with stock=10
   - Verify it stays at 10
   - Place an order
   - Verify stock decreases
   - Cancel order
   - Verify stock restores

2. **Low Stock Warning**
   - Create/update product with stock ≤ 3
   - View product detail
   - Verify red warning appears

3. **Reviews**
   - Log in as a user
   - View a product
   - Submit a review
   - Verify success toast appears
   - Verify review shows up

4. **Filters**
   - Click "Filters & Sort"
   - Change some filters
   - Click "Apply Filters"
   - Verify products filter
   - Click "Clear All"
   - Verify filters reset

5. **Today's Deals**
   - Add products to todays_deals table
   - Verify they appear on homepage
   - Verify timer counts down

6. **Multi-Seller Orders**
   - Add products from different sellers to cart
   - Place order
   - Verify single order for user
   - Log in as seller 1
   - Verify only their products show
   - Log in as seller 2
   - Verify only their products show
   - Log in as admin
   - Verify all products show with seller split

## Important Notes

1. **Run Migrations First**: Nothing will work properly until you run the SQL migrations in your Supabase SQL Editor.

2. **Update .env**: Replace placeholder values with your actual Supabase and Razorpay credentials.

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test each feature after running migrations to ensure everything works.

4. **Order System**: The multi-seller order system is complex. Test with multiple sellers to ensure proper splitting.

5. **Stock Management**: The stock system now works correctly but requires the migration to be run first.
