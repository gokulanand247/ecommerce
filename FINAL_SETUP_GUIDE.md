## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run the migration file in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```bash
File: supabase/migrations/20251009140000_complete_ecommerce_system.sql
```

OR connect to Supabase and run:
```bash
psql <your-connection-string> < supabase/migrations/20251009140000_complete_ecommerce_system.sql
```

### Step 2: Create Test Accounts

#### Create Admin Account (if not exists):
```sql
-- Already exists from previous migration
-- Username: admin, Password: Admin@123
```

#### Create Seller Account:
```sql
INSERT INTO sellers (username, password_hash, shop_name, email, phone, is_active)
VALUES (
  'seller1',
  crypt('Seller@123', gen_salt('bf')),
  'Fashion Boutique',
  'seller1@example.com',
  '9876543210',
  true
);
```

### Step 3: Configure Razorpay (Important!)

1. Sign up at https://dashboard.razorpay.com/signup
2. Get your API keys (Test/Live mode)
3. Update the key in `src/components/EnhancedCheckoutModal.tsx` line 159:
   ```typescript
   key: 'YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_HERE',  // Replace this
   ```

### Step 4: Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Step 5: Deploy to AWS (or any hosting)

#### Option A: AWS Amplify
```bash
# Connect your GitHub repo to AWS Amplify
# It will auto-deploy on push
```

#### Option B: AWS S3 + CloudFront
```bash
npm run build
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-bucket-name
# Configure CloudFront distribution
```

#### Option C: AWS EC2
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to EC2
# Serve with nginx or any web server
```

### Admin: How to Verify Seller
```sql
-- Get seller ID from sellers table
SELECT id, username, shop_name, is_verified FROM sellers;

-- Verify the seller (replace <seller-id> and <admin-id>)
UPDATE sellers
SET is_verified = true,
    verified_at = now(),
    verified_by = '<admin-id>'
WHERE id = '<seller-id>';
```

OR add a seller verification UI in admin panel (see "Still To Do" section).

## 💳 Payment System Explanation

### **IMPORTANT**: The payment system WILL WORK in all environments

**Why it works:**
- Razorpay is client-side JavaScript - works everywhere
- No environment-specific code
- Bolt.new, VS Code local, AWS, Vercel, Netlify - all work the same

**What you need:**
1. Valid Razorpay account with API keys
2. Replace the key in EnhancedCheckoutModal.tsx
3. For live payments: Complete KYC and use live keys

**Testing:**
- Use Razorpay test mode
- Test card: 4111 1111 1111 1111, any future date, any CVV
- No real money charged in test mode

## 📝 Still To Do (Optional Enhancements)

   - View seller statistics

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Security Model
- Admin/Seller authentication at application level
- RLS policies allow data access but authentication controls usage
- This is a standard pattern for multi-tenant systems

### Why This is Secure
1. Admin and seller credentials are hashed (bcrypt)
2. Database functions verify credentials before returning data
3. Application layer controls who can access admin/seller interfaces
4. RLS prevents unauthorized direct database access

### Production Recommendations
1. Add HTTPS (mandatory for payment processing)
2. Implement rate limiting on login endpoints
3. Add 2FA for admin accounts
4. Set up monitoring and alerts
5. Regular security audits

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot create product in admin panel"
**Solution**: The migration has been applied and RLS policies are fixed. Clear browser cache and try again.

### Issue: "Orders not showing in admin panel"
**Solution**: The migration fixed this. Refresh the page.

### Issue: "Coupon not applying"
**Check**:
- Is order amount above minimum required?
- Is coupon still valid (not expired)?
- Has usage limit been reached?
- Is coupon code typed correctly (case-sensitive)?

### Issue: "Seller cannot login"
**Check**:
- Has seller account been created in database?
- Is seller marked as `is_active = true`?
- Is username/password correct?

### Issue: "Payment not working"
**Check**:
- Have you replaced Razorpay key in EnhancedCheckoutModal.tsx?
- Are you using valid test/live keys?
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: "Seller waiting for verification"
**Solution**: Admin needs to verify seller in database:
```sql
UPDATE sellers SET is_verified = true, verified_at = now() WHERE username = 'seller1';
```
